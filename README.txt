Task: SE L3T05
Author: Phillip van Staden
Description: 

Compulsory Task 1
In this task, you are going to be deploying any static website that you built in a
previous task using GitHub Pages.

Follow these steps:
  ● Open GitHub and create a repository in which you will store your project.
    Remember to initialise your repository with a README. Make sure it is set to
    “Public” so that you can deploy to GitHub Pages.
  ● Click the “Upload Files” button and select all the files in your project to
    upload.
  ● Commit changes and publish that branch.
  ● If you don’t have that option, you may need to go to Settings (the cog icon)
    in your repository, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and under
    Source select “master branch”.
  ● You can now visit your own website using the URL
    https://username.github.io/repoName (with your username in place of
    ‘username’, and your repository’s name in place of ‘repoName’).
  ● For more information, go to https://pages.github.com/ and
    https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/creating
    -a-github-pages-site.
  ● Take a screenshot of your deployed website that includes the URL in the
    shot and save it to this task’s folder.
